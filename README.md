  -   I've added the chicken momentum feature. When the user unpresses the movement button, it slows at a speed of DECELERATION delta times per second.
  -   During execution the advanced feature is on by default, it can be turned off with the F4 key button.
  -   I've faced some issues with the rotation of the chicken feature, I'm not sure if it works correctly. For my calculations I mapped the coordinates as:
  
              w =  1
          p--------              Taking each cursor point and mapping it depending of the h and w
          |       |               For w the x axis doesnt change but for the y, as is the top left perspective 
          |       |               point (p). We map it and reverse by substracting the result to 2
          |       |  h = 2
          |       |               Don't really understand why it doesn't work.
          ---------

  -   I'm also not sure if the wind implementation is correct as it doesn't ereally seem like wind, and sometimes more like a normal distortion
